## 🏥 Problem Being Solved

**Healthcare Challenge**: Emergency rooms and clinics are overwhelmed with patients, leading to long wait times and inefficient triage processes. Medical professionals need AI-powered tools to quickly assess patient symptoms and prioritize care.

**Our Solution**: An intelligent medical triage system that:
- Streamlines patient check-in and data collection
- Uses AI to analyze symptoms and suggest appropriate diagnostic tests
- Provides doctors with AI-generated recommendations for review and approval
- Creates a complete digital paper trail for patient care
- Reduces wait times and improves care quality through intelligent prioritization

### Key Features

- **Patient Check-in Flow**: Name, age, gender registration
- **Vital Signs Entry**: Blood pressure, weight, temperature, SpO₂, heart rate
- **AI-Powered Triage**: Symptom analysis with OpenAI/OpenRouter integration
- **Doctor Dashboard**: Review and approve AI recommendations
- **Complete Care Plans**: Final summaries with approved tests and recommendations
- **Responsive Design**: Professional medical-grade UI with Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time Updates**: Live patient queue and status updates

   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `apps/web/.env.local`:
   ```env
   # Database - SQLite for local development
   DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
   
   # Google AI Studio API (configured and working)
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="AIzaSyAWSEuYF-p3DS0YXpItQQd3FEG7IhZx78Y"
   ```

3. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to web app directory
   cd apps/web
   
   # Generate Prisma client
   npx prisma generate
   
   # Create and push database schema
   npx prisma db push
   
   # Seed with sample data
   node seed.js
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔄 Patient Flow

### 1. Patient Check-in (`/`)
- Enter name, age, and gender
- Creates patient record in database
- Proceeds to vital signs

### 2. Vital Signs (`/vitals`)
- Optional entry of current vital signs
- Blood pressure, weight, temperature, SpO₂, heart rate
- Saves to database and proceeds to symptoms

### 3. Symptoms & AI Triage (`/symptoms`)
- Detailed symptom description
- AI analysis using OpenAI API
- Generates test recommendations, priority level, and care summary
- Creates visit record with AI suggestions

### 4. Doctor Review (`/doctor`)
- Dashboard showing all pending patient visits
- Review AI recommendations and patient information
- Approve/modify recommended tests
- Add doctor notes
- Approve or reject care plans

### 5. Final Summary (`/final`)
- Complete visit summary with approved care plan
- Printable format for patient records
- Next steps and follow-up instructions

## 🤖 AI Integration

### Google AI Studio (Gemini) Integration
- **Primary AI**: Uses Google AI Studio with Gemini 1.5 Flash model
- **API Key**: `AIzaSyAWSEuYF-p3DS0YXpItQQd3FEG7IhZx78Y` (configured)
- Structured JSON response format for medical recommendations
- Safe medical prompting (no diagnoses, only test recommendations)
- Real-time symptom analysis and care plan generation

### Fallback Mode
- Mock AI responses when API key not available
- Ensures demo functionality without API costs
- Maintains full application flow

### AI Response Format
```json
{
  "tests": ["Complete Blood Count", "Chest X-ray"],
  "summary": "Assessment summary for medical professional",
  "severity": "moderate",
  "priority": "medium", 
  "recommendations": ["Immediate care suggestions"]
}
```

## 🏥 Medical Safety

This application includes several safety measures:

- **No Medical Diagnoses**: AI only suggests tests, never diagnoses
- **Professional Review**: All AI suggestions require doctor approval
- **Clear Disclaimers**: User interface clearly states limitations
- **Audit Trail**: All decisions logged with timestamps
- **Priority Levels**: Emergency cases highlighted appropriately
